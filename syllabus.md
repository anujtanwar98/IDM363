| ----- | ---------- | ------------- | ----------- |
| A+ | 100%+ | Outstanding Work | Original ideas that demonstrate total mastery of material and the ability to critically evaluate the material logically and with synthesis as well as analysis. All material will be supported with appropriate description and citations. Use of all course materials and includes self-guided supplemental research. Material will be supremely well organized and presented in a clear and professional manner. No errors or typos will be present. |
| A | 95-99% | Very Superior Work | Demonstrates full synthesis, logic and solid analysis. Materials show appropriate description and examples to support ideas. Clear integration and connection of course materials and self-guided external research. Citations are present. Clarity and organization are strong. |
| A- | 90-94% | Superior Work | Some synthesis of materials, clear analysis based on evidence and examples. Materials discussed are from course materials and self-guided external research that display integration and connections as well as appropriate citations. Good clarity and logical organization. |
| B+ | 88-89% | Above Good Work | Mostly presentation is at the level of analysis with only a little synthesis with integration of all course materials. Some self-guided research present. No real errors but some material not fully supported by examples. Clear use of appropriate citations. Good clarity and organization. |
| B | 83-87% | Good Work | No synthesis but adequate analysis of material and reasonable use of supporting examples. All course materials are represented and connected. Some gaps in connecting ideas and organization could flow more smoothly. Appropriate citations. |
| B- | 80-82% | Slightly Below Good Work | No synthesis and some, but minimal analysis present. Heavily dependent on description without extrapolation. All course materials represented and some obvious connections are missing. Some gaps in use of examples but citations are appropriate. Writing style may need improvement in organization, clarity and logic. |
| C+ | 78-79% | Slightly Above Average Work | Only at level of description. No real analysis of material but solid use of examples in support of description. Missing use of some course materials. Integration of materials could be improved. Citations are sufficient for material. Writing style needs work on organization, clarity and logic. |
| C | 73-77% | Average Work | Only description. Could use more examples and much of what is presented is simple restating of course materials. Some requirements not fully handled. Citations are sufficient. Writing style needs work on organization, clarity and logic. |
| C- | 70-72% | Slightly Below Average Work | Level of description but no real connections between different sections course materials. Minimal use of course materials. Some parts of requirements not addressed. Citations are sufficient. Writing style needs improvement in logic, clarity and organization. |
| D+ | 68-69% | Below Average Work | Not displaying knowledge of course materials. Missing some key points but work show some attempt at making connections and in using examples to support positions. Some parts of requirements not addressed. Writing style is in need of improvement in logic, clarity and organization. Citations OK for what is presented. |
| D | 65-67% | Below Average Work | Missing some course materials. Descriptions need expansion and more examples. Little integration of material. Largely paraphrasing readings and little use of materials. Missing parts of assignment requirements. Citations OK. Need to greatly improve organization, clarity and logical presentation of material. Spelling and proofing should be improved. |
| F | 64-0% | Failure. Unacceptable Work | Not demonstrating completion of required assignments. Not addressing assignment requirements. |

## Course Policies

### Attendance

Attendance is mandatory. Students are expected to attend all classes and strictly adhere to the project due dates. Lack of participation in class discussions will count against your grade. Students are allowed one unexcused absence. If a student has more than one unexcused absence, his or her grade for the course will be reduced one letter grade. If a student has three or more absences, he or she will receive an F grade. Please also see the official Drexel University Policy on Absences at <http://www.drexel.edu/provost/policyweb/absence.html>

### Late Work

In order to receive full credit for work, students must turn in required deliverables on the specified due date. Late work will not be accepted unless you fall under the special circumstances (e.g., religious holidays, military duty, etc.). Read the link above under attendance. You are welcome, however, to submit work early.

### Critiques

Critiques are opportunities to learn and share what you’ve learned through demonstration and constructive criticism. When you present your work, you must be prepared to discuss it and address any questions concerning it. You should also take whatever criticisms you receive from faculty or students intent in which they are given, which is for you to improve. If you’re not presenting, it is expected that you give the presenter and their work your undivided attention and you are encouraged to ask questions, offer opinions and suggestions for improvement. You must take advantage of critiques for self improvement as an artist, and your participation in critiques will contribute to your class participation grade. Weekly assignments will be critiqued in class, as will the final project.

### Add, Drop and Withdrawal Policies

During the pre-enrollment period through the end of the second week of classes for the term, all students, with the exception of 1st term freshmen, may add courses that are free from restrictions/permissions, by using BANNER Web for Students. See <http://www.drexel.edu/provost/policies/course_add.asp>

If you add this course after the start of the term, you are responsible for completing ALL work that you may have missed.

For both graduate and undergraduate students, courses may only be dropped during the “drop period” lasting from the beginning of the enrollment period through the end of the second week of the quarter. Dropping a course results in the course being removed from the student’s academic record without a “W” appearing on the transcript—specifically, neither the course nor the grade of “W” appears on the student’s transcript. See <http://www.drexel.edu/provost/policies/course_drop.asp>

Drexel University allows students to drop a course through the end of the sixth week of the term. This means that you will not be allowed to drop a course, even if you are failing, after the sixth week of the term. The number of times you have already been absent, the status of your lab hours and, above all, the result of your midterm testing and other evaluations (chapter tests, quizzes, homework) are therefore your best guide to decide whether or not you should drop the course. See <http://www.drexel.edu/provost/policies/pdf/course_withdrawal.pdf>

### Accommodations for Students with Disabilities

Students with disabilities requesting accommodations and services at Drexel University need to present a current accommodation verification letter (AVL) to faculty before accommodations can be made. This MUST be done prior to the midterm! AVL’s are issued by the Office of Disability Services (ODS). For additional information, contact ODS at <http://www.drexel.edu/oed/policies/Overview/>

### Counseling and Student Health

Students with academic concerns related to this course should contact the instructor in person or via email. Students also may occasionally have personal issues that arise in the course of pursuing higher education or that may interfere with their academic performance. If you find yourself facing problems affecting your coursework, you are encouraged to talk with an instructor and to seek confidential assistance at the counseling center. Visit their website for more information: <https://drexel.edu/counselingandhealth/counseling-center/overview/>.

### Academic Integrity and Academic Honor Code

Plagiarism is the inclusion of someone else’s words, ideas, or data as one’s own work. When a student submits work for credit that includes the words, ideas, or data of others, the source of that information must be acknowledged through complete, accurate, and specific references, and, if verbatim statements are included, through quotation marks as well. By placing his/her name on work submitted for credit, the student certifies the originality of all work not otherwise identified by appropriate acknowledgments. Plagiarism covers unpublished as well as published sources. Examples of plagiarism include, but are not limited to:

- Quoting another person’s actual words, complete sentences or paragraphs, or an entire piece of written work without acknowledgment of the source
- Using another person’s ideas, opinions, or theory, even if it is completely paraphrased in one’s own words without acknowledgment of the source
- Borrowing facts, statistics, or other illustrative materials that are not clearly common knowledge without acknowledgment of the source
- Copying another student’s essay test answers
- Copying, or allowing another student to copy, a computer file that contains another student’s assignment, and submitting it, in part or in its entirety, as one’s own
- Working together on an assignment, sharing the computer files and programs involved, and then submitting individual copies of the assignment as one’s own individual work

Students are urged to consult with individual faculty members, academic departments, or recognized handbooks in their field if in doubt regarding issues of plagiarism.

#### Policy on Cheating

Cheating is an act or an attempted act of deception by which a student seeks to misrepresent that he or she has mastered information on an academic exercise that he/she has not mastered. Examples include, but are not limited to:

- Copying from another student’s test paper -Allowing another student to copy from a test paper
- Unauthorized use of course textbook or other materials, such as a notebook to complete a test or other assignment from the faculty member
- Collaborating on a test, quiz, or other project with any other person(s) without authorization
