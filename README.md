# IDM364: Interactive App Design IV

Welcome to IDM364: Interactive App Design. This course explores the basics of React (Links to an external site.), a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. Each new JavaScript framework brings something new to the table and React.js is not unique in this. What is new with React is that it challenges some of the core concepts used by the most popular front-end frameworks. This course will explore the features and functions of React.js and its component-based.

I am currently an instructor of user experience and interaction design at Drexel University. I work as the CTO and Vice President of Marketing at Gerace Enterprise, a global transportation, logistics, and warehousing company. I also work part-time as a development consultant for a design firm. I have a bachelor's degree from Drexel in Interactive Digital Media and a master's degree from the University of Florida in Educational Technology. I have more than fifteen years of experience in web design and development. This course will be intensive, and I look forward to working with all of you.

## Getting Started

### Step 1: Read the course syllabus and course schedule

The [course syllabus](./syllabus.md) will provide you with the course schedule, course objectives, explanations of assignments and assessments, and grading policies. Please read it carefully. You should have a deep familiarity with the schedule and process of the course.

### Step 2: Introduce yourself

Head over to the [discussion forum](https://github.com/Drexel-University-UXID/IDM364/discussions/16#discussion-3960193) to introduce yourself and meet your classmates.

### Step 3: Get your software setup

You will need access to a modern computer with a reliable internet connection and multiple web browsers.

#### Browsers

As a web developer, it is important to test your code on a variety of devices. You will need to install a web browser on your computer. The following web browsers are recommended:

* [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/desktop/)
* [Mozilla Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/)
* [Safari](https://www.apple.com/safari/) (macOS)
* [Microsoft Edge](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/microsoft-edge) (Windows)
* [Opera](http://www.opera.com/)

##### Nightly Builds

* [Google Chrome Canary](https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/canary/)
* [Mozilla Firefox Nightly](https://nightly.mozilla.org/)
* [Safari Technology Preview](https://developer.apple.com/safari/technology-preview/) (macOS)

#### Editor

You will also need a modern text editor, built specifically for web development. Microsoft Word is not a text editor. If you have a preferred editor already, great! If not, the following are all available for macOS and Windows:

* [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) (recommended)
* [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/)
* [Atom](https://atom.io/)

#### Version Control

We will be using Git for version control ([Learn more about Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2)). We will also be using GitHub for our repositories and collaboration. Sign up for a [GitHub account](https://github.com/join) if you don't already have one. Use your Drexel email address to unlock additional pro features on GitHub.

#### Discord

Along with GitHub discussions, the UXID program has a private [Discord](https://discord.com/) server for students to chat about their projects, classes, topics, and anything else related to the program or design and development. Register a Discord account if you don't already have one. A private link to join the UXID server will be provided in class.

#### Domain & Hosting Registration

We will be reviewing various methods for hosting our projects. It is recommended that students hold off on domain registration and hosting until we cover these topics in class. If you are looking for standard domain registration and hosting, Drexel University has an affiliation with [Bluehost](https://www.bluehost.com/track/philsinatra/).

### Step 4: Get creative

Start thinking about your first web development project. What do you want to build? What do you want to do with it? Who is your target audience? What colors do you like? What fonts are a good fit for your project? What is your style? What is your approach? The more planning you do, the better your project will be.
